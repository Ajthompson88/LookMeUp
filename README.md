# **Look Me Up - Candidate Finder**

## **Description**

### **Overview**

The Candidate Search Application is designed to help employers efficiently review and shortlist potential candidates. With a streamlined and interactive interface, users can quickly view candidate profiles and make decisions with just a click.

### **Features**

**Candidate Profile Display**:  
When the candidate search page loads, a single candidate's profile is shownâ€”including details like name, username, location, avatar, email, HTML URL, and company.  

   *  **Save Candidate**: Click the "+" button to add the current candidate to your list of potential hires and automatically view the next candidate.
   * **Skip Candidate**: Click the "-" button to move on to the next candidate without saving the current one.                                                                                  
 
**Feedback When No Candidates Remain**:      
The application clearly communicates when there are no more candidates available to review.
**Persistent Candidate List**:
Accepted candidates are displayed on a dedicated potential candidates page, ensuring that your selections persist even after page reloads. If no candidates have been accepted, a friendly message is shown.
